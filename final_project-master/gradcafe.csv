3 years in undergrad. 2.5 years of research experience, in McNair Sholars, a NSF funded program at my university which is ranked like 200th in the USA. I had an REU at CMU in computation financial mathematics. Did a paper, not published but close to it. 

God damn I'm stoked. Offer includes  ""TA or grader, for approximately
10 hours per week. For this work, you would be paid roughly $610 semi-monthly ($1221 per month), contingent on continuing satisfactory job performance, up to a total of $10,989 over the course of both semesters.""

The materials you submitted with your application have been carefully reviewed by the admissions committee, but we are unable to recommend you for admission.

The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee has the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants. Unfortunately, this may result in not being able to accept many applicants who are capable of excellent academic work.
